Welcome to Mine Sweeper Extreme!!

In this game, the game board is divided into cells. Hidden within these cells are randomly distributed bombs, or mines. 

When a player clicks a cell, one of three choices are possible with respect to the resultant identity of that cell:

1) There is a bomb! You hit a mine with your mouse and the game is over

2) there is a number corresponding to the number of bombs adjacent to the square

3) there is a blank cell, meaning there are no bombs around. In this case the adjacent squares will automatically reveal themselves in all 8 directions (sides and diagonals) up until a square is revealed that has a number identity. This happens in all 8 adjacent directions simultaneously.

For Mine Sweeper Extreme, all mines will have to be flagged to win! A player should use the cell numbers to guide them as a strategy.

A player can choose whether to play against a timer or # of moves
